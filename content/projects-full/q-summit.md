## An innovative innovation summit

Q-Summit is a conference founded by students of the University of Mannheim in 2016. Q has a focus on the topics innovation and entrepreneurship while it tries to bring students, startups and corporations together. It not even took 5 years to grow to one of the largest student organised conferences in this field with more than 1000 participants.

I joined Q-summit in the first year and was responsible for the website and setting up internal and external tooling regarding communication, collaboration and process optimization. In the first year we completely focused on making things happen, to realize the conference.

For the second year I decided to enjoy Q as a participant as I wasn't able to even listen to one presentation in the first year.

But since this was a project of the heart I joined the team again to plan the third year and restructured how we communicated via Slack, implemented G Suite for collaboration, automated processes with Zapier and introduced HubSpot to simplify the communication with our partners. All that was implemented by myself for a team of around 100 students.
