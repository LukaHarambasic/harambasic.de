## Get your lunch!

This project was built as a university project, but we had the plans to make a real product out of this. I worked together with four others and we separated the responsibilities based on our skills, therefore I focused on the concept, UI, and frontend development.

To explain a little bit better what it was all about, I picked out the introduction of our specification:

> schmackofatz. is an online platform that shows our users the **lunch menu** of nearby restaurants. In this way schmackofatz. offers undecided groups and price-conscious connoisseurs a quick decision-making aid, avoids conflicts, and helps the user to use his time more optimally.

If you want to check out the UI you can just go to Figma to see the enduser and the restaurant owner screens.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FByJe8HtmQ5aCgPcApBu3VjYz%2Fschmackofatz.%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The frontend and backend were containerized with docker to simplify the development and release process. We also included the Google Places API to get the distances from the users location to the restaurants.

In the end, we got feedback from the restaurant owners that they don't need a product like this, but nevertheless, it was a great experience working one year on an own idea in a team.
