## Technology to fight the crisis

I got the opportunity to work on the german Corona-Warn-App. While Google and Apple where still working on the Exposure Notification Framework we already started to build a native app based on the API. I focused on the UI implementation of the Android app. 

With a crazy motivated team we where able to deliver the app after 50 days. And I'll never forget the evening before our source code was published on GitHub.

And the app is quite successful even if [some politicians haven't heard about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atAy8NGOoiw). I'm just proud that I was able to build something like this, I wouldn't have dared to dream about it.

Some weeks after the final release I slowly stopped programming and took more responsibility in the team as teamlead and also Scrum Master.
