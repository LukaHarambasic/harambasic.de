A friend shared the article "[What I Use Now Instead Of Google](https://kiramclean.com/blog/what-i-use-now-instead-of-google/)" from [Kira McLean](https://twitter.com/kiraemclean) with me which then finally caused me to move my data from Google to other services. I won't be as harsh as Kira, but I'll try.

You have to know that I'm a customer of [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/). That means I used Gmail, Google Drive and of course Calendar and Contacts. During the last year I already started thinking about moving along. Of course I thought about putting a server in my basement as VServers with a view terabytes of storage a quite expensive. And as I wanted to drop the big ones I also doesn't wanted to use something like AWS S3.

## Prerequisites

* use/support open source
* prefer services in germany
* I already have 2tb of Dropbox
* have a nice user experience
* service or combination of services has to substitute

## G Suite Alternatives (SaaS)

* Fastmail
* Protonmail
* Tutanota
* Microsoft 365

## Decision

* Nextcloud on Vserver from netcup
* Mailserver from netcup
* Files & Images to dropbox
* Backup of vserver and mails to dropbox
