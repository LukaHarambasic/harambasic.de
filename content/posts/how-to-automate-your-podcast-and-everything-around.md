Together with two friends I'm hosting the podcast: [Techmob Show](https://techmob.show). As a developer I'm lazy, and I love to automate stuff. This post is about the general motivation behind all of this, and the kick off for all small series. Most of the following steps are worth an article while some others aren't.

1. How to automate your podcast and everything around it (this post)
2. Detect changes in an RSS feed - on the basis of Anchor.fm
3. Update the podcast website*
4. Generate podcast covers
5. Automatically post pictures to Instagram with Playwright
6. Wire it all up**
7. My monorepo setup with Node.js, Lerna and Typescript
8. How to deploy simple Node.js functions on Kubernetes

The posts will be linked here after they are published.

*I won't write a post about this as it's kind of trivial, if you want to see this highly complex coding checkout [GitHub](https://github.com/Techmob-Show/automation/tree/main/packages/update-website).

**Also not worth a post, it's only about connecting all the other packages, also checkout [GitHub](https://github.com/Techmob-Show/automation/tree/main/tasks/update-website-and-instagram) if you are interested.
