A friend showed me this little trick during our studies. With this you can build your own search engine. This is interesting if you often search on the same websites. From my point of view there are two main use cases search and find. I would define searching that you are open for the outcome and don't know what to expect if you want to find something you want something specific, something expected.

There are many other ways how you can achieve this, but if you have an account your search engines will be synced about multiple devices. On MacOS you could use Keyboard Maestro or on Windows Auto Hotkey to access this from everywhere with a shortcut.

## Examples

- Search
  - Translation services
    - [dict.cc]()*
    - [deepl]()*
  - Documentations
    - [Mozilla Developer Network]()
    - [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/)
  - Misc
    - [GitHub]()
- Find
  - Tickets/Issues
    - [Jira]()*
    - [GitHub]()

## How to add custom search engines

you can use every website which reflect search results in the url, e.g. it's not working on https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/

This should also work on FireFox.
