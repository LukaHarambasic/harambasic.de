A friend - [Sebastian Furkert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-furkert/) - showed me this little trick during our studies. With this you can build your own search engine. Okay that might sound a little over the top, but basically that's what you're doing. If you often search on the same websites this can save you a lot of time. 

From my point of view there are two main use cases: search and find. I would define searching that you are open for the outcome and don't know what to expect. You want to find something if you are looking for something specific, something expected, something with an identifier.

There are many other ways how you can achieve this, but if you have an account your search engines will be synced across multiple devices. On MacOS you could use Keyboard Maestro or on Windows Auto Hotkey to trigger something like this from everywhere.

## Examples

## How to add custom search engines

you can use every website which reflect search results in the url, e.g. it's not working on https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/

This should also work on Firefox.
