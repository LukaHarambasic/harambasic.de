**Active-Ambassadors is an organisation founded by Leonard Schwier and myself. The idea was to raise awarness for NGOs with the skills we have developed over the last years. For that we'll send our active ambassadors DIY kits to iron a NGO of there choice on a jersey. We don't make profit, currently we are paying a lot of the stuff by ourselves. You can see everything on our transparency page. The team grew and we are currently four people as our two Julias joined! ‚ù§Ô∏è**

Feel free to send as an email our a message on Instagram if you have any questions!

## Why this post?

I love tools! And that's my role at Active Ambassadors, handling all the tools we use and automize as much as possible. Over the last years I set up larger working enviroments even on a larger scale so I thought it might be worth sharing all this. This post targets someone who has no idea what he/she is doing (don't hesitate to send me a mail or send a Tweet) but also should inspire people with similiar setups. If you have ideas how I could improve this setup even more I'm to listen! üôÇ

Before we start: you should have this two points in mind when reading this post:

- We don't want to spend money on our IT setup, our target is to raise awarness for NGOs.
- We work 100% remotly, some of us have even met!

## The tools we use

As I'm a big fan of structured content I splitted our tools in four categories. I'll shortly go over them and explain how we use them, in the next section you'll get detailed information how we work with them and also what has been automated so far.

### Communication

<tools-list>
    <tool title="Slack" price="free" alternatives="Microsoft Teams, rocket.teams">
        Our main communication tool, as we a quite young team and grew up with
        messaging solutions in the companies we work for no one had a problem to
        adapt Slack. To be honest I'm quite surprised how it's going as everyone
        is always reachable which is really nice for a side project! If you have
        never heard of Slack: imagine it as a mix of a private forum and WhatsApp.
        Structured communication while you are chatting.
    </tool>
    
    <tool title="Google Meet" price="free" alternatives="Discord, Slack, Teamspeak">
        This is used for our meetings. It just works fine for all of us and is also available on all platforms.
