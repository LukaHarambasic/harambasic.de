## Hi, I'm Luka!

This is my personal website, heavily focusing on tech stuff. From time to time I even [write](/posts) about it. Feel free to take a look at my [projects](/projects). Currently, I study MSc Technology Entrepreneurship @ DTU. Previously, I worked two years as Mobile UX Technology Consultant @ SAP ([CV](https://harambasic.de/Luka_Harambasic.pdf) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harambasic/)). If you want to <a href="mailto:hi@harambasic.de" rel="me">chat</a> you just start a conversation about handball, woodworking or cooking.
