## Hi! I'm Luka 🧔🏻

This is my personal website, heavily focusing on tech stuff. From time to time I even [write](/posts) about it. Furthermore, I only recommend taking a look at my [projects](/projects). On the side, I work as Mobile UX Technology Consultant @ SAP ([CV](/cv) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harambasic/)). If you want to <a href="mailto:hi@harambasic.de" rel="me">chat</a> you should try to start a conversation about handball, woodworking or cooking.
