## Hi, I'm Luka!

I'm a German based in Copenhagen (Denmark). Currently, I am studying MSc Technology Entrepreneurship @ DTU. Previously, I worked as Mobile UX Technology Consultant @ SAP ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harambasic/)). Also feel free to take a look at some of my previous [projects](/projects). If you want to <a href="mailto:business@harambasic.de" rel="me">chat</a>, just start a conversation about handball, woodworking, or cooking.
