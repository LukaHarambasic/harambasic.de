desc: A friend of mien thought that we could use do something good with our skills whilst raising awareness for NGOs. I set up our work environment with Slack, Google Drive, Google Meet, Website (Nuxt.js, Prismic, Netlify), Airtable, Mailchimp, and IFTTT. Currently, we are shifting our knowledge and task management towards Notion.
