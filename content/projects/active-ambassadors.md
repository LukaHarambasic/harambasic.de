## Bring athletes and NGOs together. Make a change. Imprint your jersey now.

This project was started in April 2020 from a good friend of mine and me. He thought that we could do something good with the skills we have. Also, both of us like to take new challenges. And the basic idea is really simple:

> Raise awareness for NGOs.

The way how we do it is still not 100% defined, but we ship DIY-Kits to athletes. They become than active ambassadors when they print the logo of the NGO of their choice on their jersey. If you want to learn more about us check out the [website](https://active-ambassadors.org/). Okay, one last thing to mention: we do this for optional donations, currently we pay on top.

Here I set up our work environment: [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), Website ([Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). Currently, we are shifting our knowledge and task management towards [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

One of my favorite processes is still the website. I built everything with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), load the content data from [Prismic](http://prismic.io/), and the numbers for our transparency page are from [Airtable](https://airtable.com/). After a change in [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) gets triggered and builds a version with the latest content, this build process is also triggered when technical updates are made to the website via [GitHub](https://github.com/) or once a day via [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to get the latest [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) data as they don't provide a webhook.
