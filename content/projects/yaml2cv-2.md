## Why bother with Word or a graphics program when you can program?

I created my first CV as usual with Word and quickly felt limited by the WYSIWYG editor. I wanted to have everything exactly under my control and not make any compromises. The next logical step for me was Sketch. And although I was able to work pixel perfect, I also reached the limits here. Due to the editing of text, all elements often had to be realigned, which didn't feel optimal. Editing the text itself was no fun either. 

In the meantime my developer skills were good enough to release the first version of the CV Generator, I think it was still based on JSON. The goal was to create a tool where you could update your CV with minimal developer knowledge in a very easy way. I also wanted to host my CV on harambasic.de to be able to save my CV as PDF at any time.

One of the most beautiful moments was when friends and then suddenly also strangers used my work. Even if it's not a big number of users it's just nice to see how something I developed for myself helps others.
