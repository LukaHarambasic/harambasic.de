I have been working on the Android version of the German Corona-Warn-App. In the beginning I concentrated on the UI implementation for version 1.0.0, which we shipped after only 50 days. A few weeks later I slowly stopped programming and took on more responsibility in the team as Teamlead and Scrum Master.
