Why bother with Word or a graphics program when creating your CV? Hence, I designed and developed a tool in Nuxt.js which takes data from a YAML file and automatically created output in the design of a CV. It is easy to maintain as new entries can be added to the YAML and the CV will be updated automatically. The CV can be hosted as static page on services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
