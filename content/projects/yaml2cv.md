title: YAML2CV
desc: Why bother with Word or a graphics program when you can program? Hence I designed and developed a CV in Nuxt.js which takes the data from a YAML file. Just add a new entry in the YAML and the CV will be updated, afterwards you can host this as a static page on services like Netlify and Vercel.
