The Visitorcounter was used to visualize realtime information about visitors movements during SAP recruitment events. The project evolved from a two-man team to a team of designers, backend and frontend developers. While the project team grew, we also continously improved the technology backbone by leveraging [Calculation Views](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fc5ace7a367c434190a8047881f92ed8/2.0.03/en-US/d60ad1f0bb571014af49c9db1740d68c.html) on [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html) to accumulate the data, building the frontend with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and adding the headless CMSÂ [Prismic.io](http://prismic.io/).
