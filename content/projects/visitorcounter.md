The Visitorcounter was used to visualize in realtime where the visitors are during a recruitment event of SAP. It evolved from a two man team to a team of designers, backend and frontend developers. As the project grow on the people side we also improved the technology part, we used [Calculation Views](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fc5ace7a367c434190a8047881f92ed8/2.0.03/en-US/d60ad1f0bb571014af49c9db1740d68c.html) on [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html) to accumulate the data, built the frontend with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and added the headless CMS [Prismic.io](http://prismic.io/).
