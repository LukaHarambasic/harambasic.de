Together with Henry Stoll I was in charge of a subproject of an internal project for corporate students at SAP to build a frontend displaying visitors utilization at the international training center of SAP in Walldorf. To achieve this we cooperated with another student projects, they built the hardware to measure if there are people in a room. The data was sent to the SAP Cloud Platform IoT Service. Their Jakob MÃ¶ller and Sebastian Furkert grabbed the data to make some aggregations in Calculation Views. Henry Stoll and I consumed the OData Service in a Vue Frontend where the design was created by two Digital Media students.
