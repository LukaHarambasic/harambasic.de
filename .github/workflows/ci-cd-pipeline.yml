            The Netlify deployment for this PR has failed. Please check the [build logs](${netlifyCheck.details_url}) and fix any issues before the code review can proceed.

            **Common issues to check:**
            - Build errors or compilation failures
            - Missing environment variables
            - Asset or import path issues
            - TypeScript type errors not caught locally

            The Claude Code review will be skipped until the deployment succeeds.

            Please review this pull request and provide feedback ONLY on areas that need improvement. Do not summarize changes or praise good code.

            Focus specifically on identifying:

            üîê **Security Issues:**
            - Potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors
            - Exposed secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
            - Insufficient input validation or sanitization
            - Authentication/authorization flaws

            üìù **Code Quality Issues:**
            - Logic errors or edge cases that could cause malfunctions
            - Code style violations not caught by automated linters
            - Performance bottlenecks or inefficient implementations
            - Missing or inadequate error handling

            üéØ **Requirement Alignment:**
            - Code that doesn't match the original ticket/requirements
            - Missing functionality or incomplete implementations
            - Incorrect behavior or business logic

            ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Problems:**
            - Race conditions or concurrency issues
            - Memory leaks or resource management problems
            - Breaking changes or compatibility issues
            - Missing tests for critical functionality

            If you find issues, provide specific suggestions for improvement. If the code looks good with no actionable improvements needed, simply respond with "‚úÖ No issues found - code looks good to merge."

            Use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to leave your review as a comment on the PR.
