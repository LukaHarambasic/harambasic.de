      Tried to build a company. Spoiler: We failed.

      I remember printing hundreds of flyers, throwing them into mailboxes in my hometown, and getting exactly zero responses. I posted on LinkedIn looking for rooftops, got on calls with homeowners, and realized: I have no idea what I'm doing. What we are doing.

      We pivoted wildly trying to find something that works:

      - Solar on Shipping Containers: Too niche
      - Solar Fintech: Attempting to democratize access for departments (the main dream)
      - The Final Pivot: An app for apartment renters to participate in the green transition

      I spent nights on endless spreadsheet calculations trying to balance risk factors for homeowners against our own exposure. In the end, the math only worked with massive scale. Investors demanded a proof of concept. We realized that without deep capital or a massive network, the risk profile was impossible for three first-time founders.
