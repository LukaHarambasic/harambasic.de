      I saw a posting for an intern and loved the mission, but I told them I couldn't work part-time without pay. So we found a solution: I did this project as part of my Master's degree. This allowed me to dedicate my "study time" to building a product I actually cared about, while keeping a paying job on the side.

      - Mobile Booking System: Designed and shipped the app enabling thousands of volunteers to kayak for free in exchange for ocean cleanup. Increasing self-service rate to reduce workload for hosts.
      - Solo Builder: I acted as a one-man product team: scoping the MVP, building clickable Figma prototypes, testing with users and managing an external dev agency to get it shipped.
      - Impact: The app is live with 20,000+ downloads and actively helping clean the worlds waterways.

      PS: I might have written a few lines of code myself, but let's not look too closely at those 😊
