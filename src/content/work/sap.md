      To be honest, I used to think "SAP" was just the name of the arena where the Rhein-Neckar Löwen played Handball. I had zero idea what the company actually did until my grandma took me to their Annual General Meeting. That led to a voluntary internship in 12th grade which turned into something I would have never imagined: me leading parts of a project for all of Germany.

      Fast forward to 2020: I went from a student to the Android Lead for Germany's official COVID tracing app (Corona-Warn-App) in about 50 days. After the initial release I got to lead the team, and despite being young, I stepped up to manage 10+ developers under extreme pressure.

      - 48 Million+ Downloads: Successfully launched and maintained the app used by half the country to trace infection chains
      - 0 to 1 in 50 Days: Delivered critical public health software with no initial requirements, shipping production hotfixes for millions of users in under 6 hours
      - Open Source Wins: I was terrified our code would be torn apart publicly, but we built an amazing community. One of the most active and most knowledgeable community members turned out to be a 16-year-old student, as a little thank you! helped organize an internship for him.

      It was a weird time during Covid. We stayed on calls just to hear each other type, played "Among Us" to have some kind of team building (I always got killed first), and my roommate literally cooked and brought food to my desk so I could keep working. Danke Amdi :)

      This is a collection of the 3-month rotations I completed during my "Dual Study" program (Duales Studium). It wasn't just fetching coffee; the program requires switching between university theory and full-time practical work blocks every quarter. I was integrated as a full team member in every rotation, building a full-stack foundation across UX Design, Engineering, and Consulting.

      - Bachelor Thesis (SuccessFactors): Evaluated JavaScript Frontend Frameworks for enterprise use, conducting trend and requirement analysis.
      - Analytics Cloud (UX Design): Worked directly with customers to create User Journey Maps and Personas, building clickable prototypes in Sketch.
      - Utilities & Waste (Consulting): My first touchpoint with energy. Built a "Smart Energy Room" showcase collecting sensor data, forecasting (SAP HANA) and visualizing it in a custom SAPUIS app.
      - SuccessFactors (Dev): Developed a SAPUIS Custom Control enabling content creators to structure content matching their Corporate Identity.
      - Global Design (Enablement): Developed an internal "Dribbble-like" platform on WordPress and simplified design processes with SAP Fiori in BUILD.
