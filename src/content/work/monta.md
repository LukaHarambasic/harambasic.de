      I was originally rehired to build "Product Led Support" to stop tickets from out scaling our agents, but as big enterprise clients landed, my team had to pivot to maintaining the exports and notification service (push, sms, email). Then came the opportunity to lead a Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) project with a large Danish utility.

      After a year, we hit a wall. We were "shipping our org chart", three different squads with conflicting roadmaps trying to control the charge session of an EV: Grid, Load Management, HEMS. I pushed to merge these into one unified End-to-End Energy Management squad and strategy.

      - Scaled HEMS: Took the HEMS from 0 to 3,000+ connected homes supporting Solar inverters, Smart Meter readers (MQTT, HTTP) and CT-Clamps via OCPP.
      - Grid Services: Took ownership of the domain, expanding beyond FCR-D (DK, SE, UK) our portfolio to include aFRR (DK) and overhauling the UX to make complex flexibility markets accessible.
      - Monta Control: Rebranded and repositioned an internal utility ("CPI tool") into a customer-facing product that became Monta's AI playground.

      I've always been the "Tools Guy". I simply love tinkering with new tech, so I naturally ended up helping my colleagues figure out how to use AI to automate the boring parts of our jobs.

      - Enablement: Ran cross-department knowledge sharing and 1:1 sessions to up-level colleagues, helping them build their own automations.
      - Zapier Workflows: Built automations to scan sales and CS transcripts, ensuring I stayed on top of real customer needs and could proactively support colleagues when problems spiked (one of my fav automations).
      - Automation & AI Squad: Joined the squad to push these topics across the entire company, also hosted a hackathon.
      - First MCP Server: Built Monta's first MCP server to control the entire CPMS via prompts, hooking it up to internal systems to automate QA and generate instant, customized customer demos.

      I learned a shit ton 😞

      This was my "first date" with Monta, working part-time alongside my full-time Master's. I focused on the B2B side (the legacy Portal), getting my crash course in the EV industry and figuring out what on earth a CPMS actually is.

      I got my hands dirty early on, even coding fully functional internal tools that eventually got productized. This was way before the "vibe coding" era, so I actually had to write the code myself, including a beautiful daylight time shift (or however you call this) bug that took me forever to debug 😊.

      Full transparency: I extended the end date on this experience so LinkedIn groups it nicely with my return in 2023. In reality, I worked in this position from Aug 2022 to Feb 2023 and took a break for a semester abroad in California.
