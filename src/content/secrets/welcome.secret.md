# Welcome to Secret Content

This is a sample secret post that demonstrates the secret content functionality.

## Features

- End-to-end encryption
- User authentication
- Secure content delivery

## How it works

The content is encrypted on the server and can only be decrypted with the correct passphrase. The system uses:

1. **PBKDF2** for key derivation
2. **AES-GCM** for encryption
3. **Secure session management**

## Security Considerations

- Passphrases are never stored in plain text
- Content is encrypted at rest
- Sessions expire after 24 hours

This is just a demo content to test the functionality.
