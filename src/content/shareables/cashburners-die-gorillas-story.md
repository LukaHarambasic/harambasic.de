title: "Cashburners: die Gorillas Story"
description: "This podcast is in German. Sorry for all non-german speakers.
It tells the story of the rise and fall of the German startup Gorillas, which offered grocery delivery within ten minutes and was valued at billions of euros by investors within a few months. Despite the initial hype, the company faced criticism for poor working conditions, and eventually, a rival company took over, leading to the departure of the founder and CEO."
