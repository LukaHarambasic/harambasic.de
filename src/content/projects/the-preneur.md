During the period when I co-founded and hosted the podcast, it was known as "Technopreneur". We conducted interviews with founders of impact startups based in Copenhagen. We constructed our own studio, which accommodated recordings with up to four people. Following the production of twelve episodes, we transferred ownership of the podcast, an action that entailed a rebranding to "The Preneur".
