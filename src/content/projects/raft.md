What should I say? It's amazing! We've spent countless fun hours on this raft. Most of the materials were sourced from a recycling depot, and we bought the engine secondhand. We built it in less than 24 hours, without any formal plan. Interestingly, most of the people involved are from the software industry. "Koben" which stands for "crowbar," was the only tool we purchased, for disassembling the pallets. If you're ever in Copenhagen and fancy a ride, just let me know!
