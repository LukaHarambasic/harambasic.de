A friend of mine thought that we could do something good with our skills whilst raising awarness for NGOs. I set up our work environment: [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), Website ([Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). Currently, we are shifting our knowledge and task management towards [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
