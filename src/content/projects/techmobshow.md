Three friends needed to talk quite often about technology. Most of the time it could even be described as entertaining. They were also curious about how a podcast works. So why not start one? The Techmob Show was born. The first season contains eight to ten episodes, eight are published, ten are recorded. It's like Schrödinger's cat.
