I worked on the Android version of the German Corona-Warn-App. In the beginning, I focused on the UI implementation for version 1.0.0, which was released after only 50 days of development. A few weeks later, I took on even more responsibility and facilitated the development as team lead and scrum master. The app had in the end over 40 million downloads (germany).
