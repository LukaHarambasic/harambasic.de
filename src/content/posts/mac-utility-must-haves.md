## Motivation

some people still dont know, and as selfish as i am i just want to have something i can send to people

## Screenshots to clipboard

> build in

Copy to clipboard to paste it somewhere directly
used snagit had it at my old employer even bought i personally but since a newer macos version its build in

## Clipboard manager

> clippy

Clipboard manager, windows has it on board, i tweak it a little bit quicker to giv eme direct access

## Switching between windows

> alt tab

like windows, mutliple instances of the same program

## Windom management

> rectangle

shortcuts but i use it mainly for tha snapping with the mouse and full screen when double clicking title

## Better Spotlight search

> raycast

nerdy, but also something for everyone

- opening applications
- doing calculations
- currency calculations
- emoji search

and a lot of other thigns via plugins

but you also can trigger apple shortcuts, so you can build with the nice apple ui automations that you than easily can trigger from there
